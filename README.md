This is the `me.neversleep.plusplus` module that was unpublished from the LSPosed repo for unknown reasons. Metadata and usage instructions: https://github.com/liyafe1997/me.neversleep.plusplus.

- Short description: Xposed module that allows turning screen off while keep everything running as if the screen was on.
- LSPosed scope: system
- Usage summary: Access configuration UI by clicking the settings icon in the LSPosed scope selection screen. To toggle conveniently, use the quick settings tile.

The earliest source code I can find for now is https://github.com/nian0114/FakeScreen. Probably that the original source code repo has also been unpublished.

This version is supposed to work on Android 8~16, and is confirmed to work on my Android 16 device (the main feature works while the "disable sleep" feature does not).
